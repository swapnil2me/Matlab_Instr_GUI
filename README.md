# Matlab_Instr_GUI
### Ready to use Matlab GUI for controlling
* SRS 830, SRS 844 lock in amplifier
* Sohde and Schwarz Signal Generators
* Keithley SMUs

### The code performs following
* Creates a parameter space of drive voltages
* Creates a frequency sweep for each drive voltage

### It can be used for
* Electrostatic actuation of Mechanical Resonators
* Elecrostatic detection of Mechanical Resonance
  * [with Direct Capacitive Detection](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smll.200500077 "Direct Measurement")
  * [with Mix-Down Detection](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02905 "Mix-Down Measurement")
